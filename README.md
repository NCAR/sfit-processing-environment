# sfit4 - pre/post processing python package distribution

Python package used for pre and post-processing of sfit4. This package is recommended for the release of [SFIT4 v1.0](https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-core-code/tree/Official_Release_1.0)

Python package used for:

* **Preprocessing of spectra: building a spectral database, acquiring auxiliary data e.g. NCEP z-p-t profiles, and water vapor profiles**
* **Batch running of SFIT4 on large sets of spectra**
* **Running the error analysis codes post retrieval**
* **Plotting standard outputs**
* **Using the database and retrievals to build GEOM compliant HDF files**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
The step-by-step procedures and computing tools are described in more detailed in the [OT_FTS_Spectral_Processing.pdf](https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-processing-environment/blob/Official_Release_v3.0/OT_FTS_Spectral_Processing.pdf).
Additional resources can be found in the [sfit4wiki](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/sfit4/) - The NCAR sfit wiki webpage.


### Prerequisites

Below are the standard python libraries needed in order to run sfit-processing-environment.
The package has been tested with python >=2.7. However, Python 2.7 reached the end of its life on January 1st, 2020 and it is not maintaned.
Python3 is prefered.
Note: The installation of python3 and these libraries are not covered here.

```
os, sys, numpy, matplotlib, Tkinter, datetime, time, math, csv, itertools, collections, re,
scipy, pyhdf, cycler, h5py, abc, getopt, glob, logging, shutil, fileinput, subprocess, netCDF4
```

### Installing sfit-processing-environment

The sfit-processing-environment can be found here:

* [github](https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-processing-environment.git) - The NCAR github sfit - sfit-processing-environment.

This is the repository with several contributors/branches. The branch with the relese version is **Official_Release_v3.0**.
To install Official_Release_v3.0 locally in the current working directory:

```
git clone -b Official_Release_v3.0 https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-processing-environment.git
```

<!--* [2) github - zip](https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-processing-environment/releases) - Here you can download a tar/zip file.

Installation via its setup.py script

Use tar to unpack the archive, for example:

```
$ tar -xzf sfit-processing-environment-3.0.tar.gz
```

Change to the new directory (cd), and then, to install it in a prefered directory, for example, using python 3 enter

```
$ python3 setup.py install --home=<dir>
```

The --home option defines the installation base directory. Files are installed to the following directories under the installation base as follows: /dir/lib/python.
More information on [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3.3/install/index.html)

Alternatively, you can use --user option directs setup.py to install the package in the user site-packages directory for the running Python; for example:

```
python3 setup.py install --user
```
and will be installed, for example,

```
~//usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/
```

where X.Y stands for the version of Python, for example 3.8 -->



### Deployment

<!--*In theory, when using python3 setup.py install --user python automatically searches this directory for modules, so prepending this path to the PYTHONPATH environmental variable is not necessary.  -->
It is recommended to add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables. For example, add the following path to your shell, i.e., a program designed to start other programs (.bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile) e.g., open your .bash_profile

```
$ vi ~/.bash_profile
```
and insert the following, for example,

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/Layer1
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/Layer1
```

<!-- V3.0 test -->
<!--SPE=/myhomedir/V3.0/lib/python -->
<!--export PYTHONPATH=$SPE/HDFread:$SPE/HDFsave:$SPE/Layer0:$SPE/Layer1:$SPE/ModLib:$SPE/Plotting:$SPE/RefProfiles:$SPE/SpectralDatabase:$PYTHONPATH -->


use the above for all folders.

Additionally, the main python scripts on each folder use the shebang (top line in any script for standalone executable without typing python):

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

you can either modify the line with your prefered python version or type your python version in the command line, for example,

```
$ /usr/bin/python2.7 sfit4Layer1.py -?
```

Depending on the installation, often, especially when using the --home option it is necessary to change permissions to the directory. In this case, you might use the command below under the directory, e.g., under /dir/lib/python

```
$ sudo chmod -R 755 *
```


## Running the tests

If the above packages have been added to the PATH & PYTHONPATH and the shebang has been modified to your python version you can test

```
$ sfit4Layer1.py -?
```

otherwise go to, e.g., the Layer1 folder and type

```
$ python3 sfit4Layer1.py -?
```

if successfully, the output might look like this

```
  -i <file>                              : Flag to specify input file for Layer 1 processing. <file> is full path and filename of input file
  -l                                     : Flag to create log files of processing. Path to write log files is specified in input file
  -L <0/1>                               : Flag to create output list file. Path to write list files is specified in input file
  -P <int>                               : Pause run starting at run number <int>. <int> is an integer to start processing at
  -d <20190101> or <20190101_20191231>   : Date or Date range
                                         -d is optional and if used these dates will overwrite dates in input file for Layer 1 processing
  -?                                     : Show all flags
```
