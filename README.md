# sfit4 - pre/post processing python package distribution

Python package used for pre and post-processing of sfit4. This package is recommended for the release of [SFIT4 v1.0](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/sfit4/)

Python package used for:

* **Preprocessing of spectra: building a spectral database, acquiring auxiliary data e.g. NCEP z-p-t profiles, and water vapor profiles**
* **Batch running of SFIT4 on large sets of spectra**
* **Running the error analysis codes post retrieval**
* **Plotting standard outputs**
* **Using the database and retrievals to build GEOM compliant HDF files**

## Getting Started

Important resources can be found in the [SFIT Processing Environment](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/sfit4/SFIT+Processing+Environment) webpage. Addinional step-by-step procedures and computing tools are described in more detailed in the [OT_FTS_Spectral_Processing.pdf](https://github.com/NCAR/sfit-processing-environment/blob/Official_Release_v3.0/OT_FTS_Spectral_Processing.pdf).
